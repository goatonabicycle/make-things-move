# What is a module? 

A module is a folder that specifically contains the following: 
  `index.html` - generally a file that have a div for whatever you want your script and styles to be loaded into.
  `script.js` - the javascript that is loaded into the index.html file. It's important to IIFE-ify this file. 
  `style.css` - the css that is loaded into the index.html file.
