This is really nothing right now. 

I intend for it to be a cool collection of silly animation stuff.

todo: 

- Have all the different movements exist in the same space. (Currently there are 3 different things)
- Have a way to switch between the different sub movements
- Have a way to change the speed of the animations
- Have a way to change the size of the animations
- Have a way to change the color of the animations
- Have a way to change the direction of the animations
